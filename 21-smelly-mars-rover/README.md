# Legacy Code & Test Smells Kata - Mars Rover

## Overview

This kata is a **fixture, not a from-scratch TDD exercise**. It is a Mars Rover
mission simulator (inspired by `11-mars-rover` and `18-esa-mars-rover`) built
deliberately as legacy code: some of it has **zero tests**, and the part that
does have tests has **deliberately smelly ones**. It exists to practice (or to
exercise tooling for):

- detecting legacy testability blockers and choosing a seam or fallback strategy
- characterization testing of code with no tests and no documentation
- detecting and refactoring test smells in an existing, badly-tested suite
- deciding, for one codebase, which parts need "add tests" work and which parts
  need "fix the existing tests" work

Unlike `16-smelly` (which bakes in **production code smells** to refactor),
this kata bakes in **testability blockers** and **test smells** -- the two
things that make legacy code hard to safely add tests to.

None of the production or test classes contain any explanatory comments.
Finding and naming each blocker and each smell is part of the exercise -- this
README intentionally does not say where they are.

## Current State

| Area                                                          | Coverage | What's wrong                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Rover`, `ObstacleSensor`, `RadioTransmitter`, `MissionClock` | **0%**   | no tests at all                                              |
| `CommandTranslator`, `MissionLog`, `Coordinate`                | tested   | tests exist, but nearly all of them are smelly               |

## Problem Description

A rover lands on a square plateau (`gridSize x gridSize`, wrapping at the
edges) and receives a string of commands:

- `L`: rotate 90° left
- `R`: rotate 90° right
- `M`: move forward one grid point

A hidden `ObstacleSensor` blocks a move into specific grid squares; when that
happens the rover reports the obstacle over `RadioTransmitter` and stops where
it last was, returning `O x y direction`. Otherwise it returns its final
`x y direction`.

Commands can also arrive in Spanish, French, Portuguese, or Italian and must be
translated to `L`/`R`/`M` first (`CommandTranslator`), and every translated
sequence is written to a `TelemetryPort` (`MissionLog`).

## What to Look For

The 0%-covered part of the production code has several deliberate testability
blockers -- things that make a class hard or impossible to put under test as
is. Before writing a single test, identify each one and name it using a
legacy-code testability taxonomy of your choice (constructor does real work,
hardcoded dependency, singleton/global state, static method with a side
effect, non-determinism with no seam, etc.).

The existing tests currently all pass, but the suite is deliberately smelly.
It represents every smell from this catalogue at least once:

Logic in Test, Mock Overuse, Test Interdependence, Fragile Test, Mystery
Guest, Eager Test, Assertion Roulette, Obscure Test, Test Code Duplication,
Conditional Test Logic, Hard-Coded Test Data, Testing Private Methods, Slow
Unit Test, Mocking Final/Concrete Classes, Mocking Value Objects,
Implementation Coupling, Shared Mutable State, Port-Boundary Violations,
Testing Theater.

Some smells overlap in the same test. None of them are labeled in the code.

## Tasks

Pick one direction (or both, on separate branches):

1. **Add tests, outside-in** -- `Rover` has none. Start at the acceptance level
   (a full command string in, a result string out), then unit-characterize
   `ObstacleSensor`'s obstacle grid, then decide what seam each hardcoded
   dependency needs before any of that is even possible.
2. **Fix the existing tests** -- everything currently passes, but almost none
   of it protects real behavior. Detect each smell, then refactor it without
   ever weakening or deleting a test to make it pass.

## Tips

- Do not fix a testability blocker and add new tests in the same change --
  seam refactors are a separate, behavior-preserving change from test
  additions.
- The smelly tests currently pass. That is the point: passing is not the same
  as protecting anything.
- Run mutation testing after any test addition or fix -- high coverage on
  this code with weak assertions is exactly what several of the smells above
  look like from the outside.

## Testing

This module uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ, with Mockito available for test
doubles (matching the style of the pre-written smelly tests, which use
Mockito the way the original TypeScript kata uses Jest mocks).
