# Mars Rover kata

## Problem

A robot rover is landed by NASA on a plateau on Mars.
The plateau is divided up into a grid to simplify navigation.
This plateau, must be navigated by the rover so that it´s on-board cameras can get a complete view of the surrounding terrain to send back to Earth.

## Input

- The rover receives three lines of input:
  - The first line defines the upper-right coordinates of the plateau.
    - Example: ‘5 5’
    - The lower-left coordinates are always ‘0 0’.
  - The second line contains the rover’s starting position and direction.
    - Example ‘1 2 N’ measn x=1, y=2 and Direction=North
    - Assume that the square directly North from (x, y) is (x, y+1).
  - The third line contains the sequence of commands to execute.
    - Example: ‘LMLMLMLMM’
    - ‘L’ and ‘R’ makes the rover spin 90 degrees left or right respectively, without moving from its current spot.
    - ‘M’ means move forward one grid point, and maintain the same heading.

### Example input

```text
55
12N
MLMLMLMM
```

Assume that NASA will never send invalid messages to the rover, nor will it send a message moving the rover outside the defined grid.

## Output

The output for the rover should be its final co-ordinates and heading.

```text
1 3 N
```

## Examples

### Input 1

```text
5 5
1 2 N
LMLMLMLMM
```

### Expected Output 1

```text
1 3 N
```

### Input 2

```text
5 5
3 3 E
MMRMMRMRRM
```

### Expected Output 2

```text
5 1 E
```

## First run

Implement the Mars Rover as best as you can using TDD.

### Example starting code

```typescript
const rover = new Rover();
const finalPosition = rover.execute('5 5\n1 2 N\nLMLMLMLMM');
```

## Second run

Refactor the code you produced in the first run using design patterns, namely Command, State and Strategy.
