# Shopping Cart Kata

## Goal

Implement a shopping cart system using:

- Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal architecture
- Use case driven development
- In-memory database implementation
- Comprehensive testing strategy

This module ships as a minimal starter scaffold, not a solution: an empty
`Cart` domain model for you to design, a `ShoppingCartRepository` port typed
loosely against `Object` (until you've designed `Cart`, there is nothing
more specific to type it against), a stub `InMemoryShoppingCartRepository`
adapter, and three empty use-case interfaces. There are no tests yet --
writing them, outside-in, is part of the exercise.

## Testing Requirements

Create a robust testing suite including:

- **Acceptance Tests**: End-to-end scenarios (excluding repositories)
- **Unit Tests**: For use cases, aggregates/entities, and domain services
- **Integration Tests**: For repository implementations
- Tests should be treated as first-class citizens with production-quality code

This module uses JUnit 5 and AssertJ, with Mockito available for test
doubles.
