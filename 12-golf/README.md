# Refactoring Golf

- Start on hole 1 and refactor the code to be like the code in hole 2
  - Use a diff tool to see the differences in code between the starting hole and end hole
- Move to hole 2 and refactor the code from hole 2 to be like the code in hole 3
- Apply the same pattern until you reach hole 13
- Remember to keep the code compiling and the tests passing at all times during the refactor
- For every refactor, run the tests, and if they pass, commit
- It's okay, and actually heavily encouraged, to revert back to a previous working state at any moment
- Give each hole at least 3 attempts for each run.

## Before you start

- Make sure you have identified as many code smells on the starting hole as possible.
- Make sure the code builds, and tests are passing `yarn golf`
- Each hole has its own test script; use `yarn golf1` for the first hole and so on for each hole.

## First run

- Refactor the code as best as you can.
  - Using pen and pencil, take note of the following:
    - For every compilation error you get during or after a refactor, count 1 strike.
    - For every failing test during or after a refactor, count 2 strikes.

## Second run

- Refactor the code following the treatments available for each code smell in <https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells>.
  - Using pen and pencil, take note of the following:
    - For every compilation error you get during or after a refactor, count 1 strike.
    - For every failing test during or after a refactor, count 2 strikes.

## Third run

- Refactor the code following the treatments available for each code smell in <https://refactoring.guru/refactoring/smells>. Use automated IDE refactoring as much as possible.
  - Using pen and pencil, take note of the following:
    - For every manual edit, count 1 strike.
      - Any code formatting applied does not count as a manual edit
      - Deleting blank lines or blank spaces does not count as a manual edit
    - For every compilation error you get during or after a refactor, count 1 strike.
    - For every failing test during or after a refactor, count 2 strikes.
